# 🛠️ Mechanical Design Portfolio

Welcome to my **Mechanical Design Portfolio** — a curated collection of projects, practice files, and simulations I’ve worked on while learning mechanical CAD tools from scratch.

This repository showcases my journey in mastering industry-standard design software such as **AutoCAD**, **Fusion 360**, **SolidWorks**, and **FreeCAD**.

## 📌 Contents

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `/2D_Drawings` | Technical sketches, orthographic views, and dimensioned drawings made using AutoCAD |
| `/3D_Models` | Individual part models (e.g., nut, bolt, piston) created using SolidWorks and Fusion 360 |
| `/Assemblies` | Functional assemblies (e.g., clamps, gear systems) with joint constraints |
| `/Simulations` | Basic static/dynamic simulation results (where applicable) |
| `/Projects` | Mini-projects and creative designs combining multiple parts |
| `/Docs` | Screenshots, PDF drawings, and model exports (STL, STEP, DWG) |

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in mechanical design principles
- Gain hands-on experience with CAD tools
- Create a professional portfolio to showcase for job applications or internships
- Learn proper documentation and version control using Git and GitHub

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **AutoCAD** – for 2D drafting and schematics
- **Fusion 360** – for 3D modeling and assemblies (cloud-based)
- **SolidWorks** – for parametric modeling and simulations
- **FreeCAD** – open-source alternative for modeling and drafting
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and sharing

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

- Followed online tutorials (e.g., CADCAM Tutorials, Lars Christensen)
- Recreated industrial components from blueprints
- Documented my progress and challenges in each project
- Organized work with consistent folder structure
